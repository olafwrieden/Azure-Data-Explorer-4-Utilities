## ADX 4 Utilities

ðŸ‘‰ Data to dashboard: a demo of Azure Data Explorer (ADX) for the utilities sector.

[Azure Data Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/data-explorer) (ADX) is Microsoft's lighting fast, fully managed data analytics service for real-time terabyte-scale data analysis. It empowers adhoc queries across complex datasets to quickly identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in your data.

> ðŸš€ **Our Goal:**
This demo focuses the implementation of Azure Data Explorer in the Utilities sector. We will explore how ADX can be used to ingest, query, and visualise sensor data to securely surface trends over time.

## Our Approach

1. Generate fake meter data.
2. Ingest (and transform) meter data into Azure Data Explorer.
3. Configure ingestion policies to backdate datasets.
4. Run adhoc queries and gain insights from the meter data.
5. Build a utilities dashboard to visualise our queries.

## Dataset: Electricity Meter Data

In this demo, we will be working with fake electricity meter reading data. A Python script is included to generate datasets similar to those an electricity meter generates before it sends the data to the cloud.

ðŸ’¡ Run the included [Data Generator](generator/DataGenerator.py) script to generate a fake dataset of meter readings.
